# hashmap
This project's goal is to create a [HashMap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) using Ruby.

Methods implemented:
* `#set` or `#[]=`
* `#get` or `#[]`
* `#has?` or `#key?`
* `#remove`
* `#length` or `#size`
* `#clear`
* `#keys`
* `#values`
* `#entries`

This project was created as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap).
